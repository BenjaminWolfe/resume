#' 
#' * Teaching dates are approximate.
#' * Technically I began at Farmers as a Marketing Trainee
#'   (for that matter I was a temp before that),
#'   and I believe I ended as a Senior Marketing Specialist.
#'   They did not have an analyst title at my location,
#'   but it was offered to me as they created a new team just before I left.
#' * Farmers start date is approximate; dates after that are accurate.
#' 
#' Esurance management titles are nuanced as well.
#' 
#' * I started _managing_ with my first hire, before being promoted to manager.
#'   (See _people managed_, below.)
#' * While I never had the title of "Manager of Data Science,"
#'   we handled data science work, and my reports were data scientists.
#'   With the hiring of Deepak Ramanathan on 2014-09-24,
#'   my team was subsumed under the newly formed Data Science Group.
