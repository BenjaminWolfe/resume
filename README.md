# Resume

Current final HTML is at [paged-js/index.html](paged-js/index.html).

Current final PDF is at [output/resume.pdf](output/resume.pdf).

For a full write-up of the details from the timeline visual on my resume,
see [scripts/timeline.html](scripts/timeline.html).

To re-create, run [scripts/timeline.R](scripts/timeline.R),
followed by [paged-js/index.Rmd](paged-js/index.Rmd).

## To Do

I left the CSS in disarray, with plenty of cruft
from the original `pagedown` resume template.
I would certainly enjoy cleaning that up and making it more presentable.
